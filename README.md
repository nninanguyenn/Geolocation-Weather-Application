# Geolocation-Weather-Application
The Weather App lets users search for current weather and hourly forecasts by city. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it uses the OpenWeatherMap API to display the temperature, weather description, and icon, along with a 24-hour forecast. The app features a modern, responsive design for an enhanced user experience.

# STEP ONE: Installing Python (if it’s not installed)

If Python is not installed, follow these steps to install it:

Using Homebrew (recommended for macOS):
If you don’t have Homebrew installed, you can install it by running the following command in your terminal:
    
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

After Homebrew is installed, install Python by running:

    brew install python


# STEP TWO: Run the HTTP Server Again

Navigate to your project directory:

    cd path/to/your/WeatherApplication

Start the server:

    python3 -m http.server

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000.
