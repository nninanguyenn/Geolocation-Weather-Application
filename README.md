# Geolocation-Weather-Application
The Weather App lets users search for current weather and hourly forecasts by city. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it uses the OpenWeatherMap API to display the temperature, weather description, and icon, along with a 24-hour forecast. The app features a modern, responsive design for an enhanced user experience.
